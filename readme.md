# Hiyori CLI
Hiyori CLI is being developed to create and maintain [HiyoriDB](https://github.com/Hiyori-API/HiyoriDB) â€” a relational Anime and Manga Database.

## Process
Hiyori CLI works by crawling sources, parsing the data, and transforming them into the Hiyori Schema which contains combined metadata gathered from sources.
This metadata is stored in MongoDB. When other source processes are run, then it focuses on updating the metadata with missing information.

Hiyori also collects relational mappings from other sources (if available) and uses that to populate `references` in the schema.
Supported references have parsers and are able to extract the ID of the entry for that source and store them in `reference_ids`.

## Hiyori Schema
Common data with different representations like status (MAL: "Finished Airing", Anilist: "Finished") are transformed into a common value via Hiyori's Enums.
